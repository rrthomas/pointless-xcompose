All files in this distribution use UTF‐8 pointlessly.  Read them in a
font with good Unicode coverage — say, DejaVu Sans Mono or GNU unifont
(xfonts-unifont).

Background
==========

If you know what the words “~/.XCompose”, “ISO_Level3_Shift”, “input
method”, “character map”, “deadkey” and “xmodmap” mean, you can skip
to the next section.

Still there? So.  Unicode has lots of cool characters.  I mean lots
and lots of cool characters.  Enough characters to annoy all your
friends with useless charatry.

Your keyboard doesn’t have nearly enough keys to input all them.

In X — the GUI system used in Linux, BSD, Solaris &c. — there are a
number of different ways to input these extra characters:

 • Copy and paste from the web, a reference file, or a character map
   utility such as gucharmap(1).  Easy to do and fail‐proof, but
   tedious and labor‐intensive.

 • Enter the Unicode character by its code point (a number that
   uniquely identifies it; tipically in four‐digit hexadecimal).  Ways
   to input these numbers include the Ctrl+Shift+u shortcut on certain
   setups, the ucs‐insert Emacs function, web services, and charmap
   apps.  Less labor‐intensive, but requires you to memorize or look
   up the numbers for every character you want.

 • Use one of your keys as a character modifier — tipically the right
   Alt key (aka AltGr), set as ISO_Level3_Shift or Mode_switch (these
   are X names for key meanings).  In my experience this method tends
   to be buggy; for example, in the Xorg version I’m using right now,
   you can’t set an AltGr mapping for an US keyboard unless the US
   international variant touches that key.  Due to the way X sets keys
   (with xmodmap(1)), AltGr is also very tedious to configure, and
   it’s a method that limits you to one extra character per key (or
   two, combined with Shift).

 • Use a X keyboard layout with deadkeys.  A “dead” key is one that
   prints nothing on the screen; when you press another key, it will
   decide on a character that combines both and output it.  These are
   common with users of European languages (most, for example, have a
   “dead acute” key that will combine with vowels to make áéíóú, &c.).

 • Use a custom input method (IM).  These are extra software that sit
   between your input and X and use sophisticated methods to translate
   keypresses to characters; examples include SCIM, uim, anthy, &c.
   This method is necessary for users of complex languages like
   Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Indic scripts &c, who needs many more
   characters than Europeans.  IMs are kind of tricky to configure for
   the first time, but easy to use from there on.  As far as I know,
   no current input method make it simple to extend with your own
   arbitrary character mappings (though they often are easy to extend
   with characters of the language they target).  Some old IMs break
   deadkeys, making the life of bilingual European‐Asian speakers even
   more difficult than it already is.

 • Use X Compose mappings.  This method is a X mechanism to input
   arbitrary characters by pressing fixed key sequences.  Most Compose
   sequences begin with the Compose key, also known as Multi_key (not
   available in standard keyboards; you have to assign a Windows key
   or something to it).  The deadkey method mentioned above is
   actually implemented with Compose too.  Xorg comes with many
   builtin mappings described in /usr/share/X11/locale/*/Compose, and
   you can add your own in ~/.XCompose.  Compose has its quirks, but
   IMHO it’s the easiest method to extend in your own way and use
   system‐wide.

WHATIS
======

Pointless‐XCompose is a distribution of extra Compose mappings for
many uncommon Unicode characters (actually it’s just my ~/.XCompose
file better organized and documented).  I encourage interested parties
to use it as a starting point to make your own Compose sequences.  I
lost so many days in this useless timesink, I want to get revenge by
making the world suffer through it too.

I also included a few other potentially interesting Compose‐related
stuff, such as a selection of standard X mappings, a script to
generate deadkey variants of Compose files, &c.  Or, to be throughly:

INSTALL
=======

1. Copy or git-clone this directory to somewhere safe (I use
   /usr/local/share/pointless-xcompose/).

2. If you have a ~/.XCompose file, skip to the next step.  If not,
   create one (notice the two‐letter capitalization).  If you’re lazy
   you can copy the one in examples/ and skip to 4, else keep
   reading.  You probably want this line in it to pull default X
   compose mappings from
   e.g. /usr/share/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose:

     include "%L"

   If you use an en_US.UTF-8 locale but want another locale‐specific X
   mapping, include that one instead.  I’m thinking Brazilian users,
   who most probably will want this line to make dead_acute + c
   generate a cedilla instead of a c with accent:

     include "/usr/share/X11/locale/pt_BR.UTF-8/Compose"

   I recommend reading the Xorg en_US.UTF-8 Compose file (or the
   summary included in doc/), there’s lot of interesting things there.

3. Below the X includes in your ~/.XCompose add all extras you want:

     include "/path/to/pointless-xcompose/abbrevs.xcompose"
     include "/path/to/pointless-xcompose/arrows.xcompose"
     include "/path/to/pointless-xcompose/dingbats.xcompose"
     …

4. Skip to the next step if you don’t use X deadkeys.  If you do use
   them (for example, if you use an XKB layout like “us_intl”,
   “us(intl)”, or “br”), let’s create deadkey versions of the mappings
   now:

    pointless-xcompose$ ./bin/make-dead-compose.rb \
                        /usr/share/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose \
                        /path/to/pointless-xcompose/math.xcompose \
                        # …list all Compose files you want to include \
                        # or just use /pointless-xcompose/*.xcompose =) \
                        > dead.xcompose

   Then include the deadkeys file:

     include "/path/to/pointless-xcompose/dead.xcompose"


5. If you already have a Compose (Multi_key) key, skip to the next
   step.  Else let’s configure one now.  There’s a new way of doing
   this using setxkbmap(1), but I’ve seen it not working, so I
   recommend you use good old xmodmap(1) instead.  First decide which
   key you want to use; most people go with Menu or right Windows.
   Open a console, run xev(1), and press your chosen key a few times.
   Take note of its keycode in the line “keycode <nnn> = <blah>” (for
   example, my Menu key is keycode 135).  Then run the following
   command:

     xmodmap -e "keycode <nnn> = Multi_key"

   Use xev again to make sure it worked, then add the xmodmap command
   (between quotes, above) to ~/.xmodmap.

   If you use gnome, next time you login it might ask whether you want
   to use Gnome keyboard settings or “X” settings.  This is because
   Gnome overrides many X keyboard configurations for no good reason.
   Choose X settings.  You can also try System→Preferences→Keyboard,
   at your own risk.

6. Restart your apps (and perhaps X the first time) — XCompose
   settings only apply for new windows.  I do suspect you need an
   UTF-8 locale set, though I didn’t test.

7. Fix GTK.  XCompose configuration unfortunately won’t work in GTK
   apps by default; GTK defines its own static, compile‐time,
   nonconfigurable compose mechanism which overrides X.  They do copy
   X Compose mappings from time to time, so GTK compose most of the
   time are almost the same as X defaults.  It will break where you
   most need it, of course.  And there’s no way at all to add your own
   mappings or otherwise configure them.

   A possible workaround is to use the “xim” GTK input method, but
   that didn’t work for me.  Another workaround is to use the uim GTK
   input method (install uim, then export GTK_IM_MODULE=uim in your
   ~/.gnomerc; thanks to uim’s author, Etsushi Kato, for pointing me
   his solution).  There’s no need to run any software, and it won’t
   otherwise touch your keyboard settings.  If you’re a SCIM user,
   consider switching to uim.

   If you’re as annoyed as I am, do complain to GTK devs:

USAGE
=====

Read the included *.xcompose files and doc/xorg-compose-extracts to
see what mappings are included.

Compose settings can conflict due to lack of terminators.  Suppose
you have this sequence:
 • Compose . . =      → ·
 • Compose . . . =    → …
Now when you type «Compose . .», X won’t print anything because it’s
waiting for «Compose . . .» (IMHO it should print · and then change it
to … should you type another period, but I digress).  In other words,
you can’t make mappings that are substrings of other mappings.  That
means you probably don’t want to set Compose shortcuts for U2A94
GREATER-THAN ABOVE SLANTED EQUAL ABOVE LESS-THAN ABOVE SLANTED EQUAL
(⪔).

All the mappings here have been painstakenly compared agains Xorg
1.6.0’s en_US Compose file for conflicts.  Several of my entries are
present in X’s Compose as another sequence, but I prefer one that’s
more mnemonic.  Some entries are duplicated for consistency sake;
these are commented out with two ## symbols.  The few entires that
replace X mappings are marked as such.

Conventions:

 • Termination convention (copied from X):
   ◦ A repeated character: Compose v v → ✓
   ◦ Where that would conflict, a period:
     ‣ Compose - .      → − (true hypen)
     ‣ Compose - - .    → – (en‐bar)
     ‣ Compose - - -    → — (em‐bar)
   (Side note: the difference between the above three characters is
    small in monospaced fonts, but large in proportionals).
